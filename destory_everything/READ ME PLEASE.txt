seriously.
please dont use this
it literally just clears a directory of file types.

wont clear folders either just files
you probably wont recover them either so yeah


i was bored and this sounded fun so ahhh enjoy

IF YOU DO USE:
  IT WILL CLEAR EVERY FILE THAT IT HAS ACCESS TO, INCLUDING ITSELF AFTERWARDS.
  USE INSIDE OF THE DIRECTORY YOU WISH TO CLEAR!
